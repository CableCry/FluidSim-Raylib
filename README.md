# FluidSim-Raylib
This is a eulerian fluid simulation, based on these two papers:
- [Mike Ash's Fluid Simulation for Dummies](https://mikeash.com/pyblog/fluid-simulation-for-dummies.html)
- [Jos Stam's Real Time Fluid Dynamics for Games](https://www.dgp.toronto.edu/public_user/stam/reality/Research/pdf/GDC03.pdf)

### Running
If you are on windows, you can download one of the binaries in release, just run the program and mess around with it. For other platforms, you can build the project from the source, as long as you have raylib downloaded. You can point it to your directory and run the makefile.
